# Commands

DSPy CLI helps you build LLM systems that iterate fast and scale without breaking. Start simple, add complexity when you need it, and let DSPy handle optimization.

## Workflow

```
dspy-cli new      → Start with structure that scales
dspy-cli serve    → Iterate without breaking things
dspy-cli generate → Add complexity safely
[Future: dspy-cli optimize → run DSPy optimization]
```

## Available Commands

### [new](new.md) - Start with structure that scales

Create projects with built-in best practices. Skip the boilerplate, avoid common pitfalls, and get a foundation ready for DSPy's optimization tools.

### [serve](serve.md) - Iterate without breaking things

Test your prompts and logic with a live API server. Auto-discovery turns your modules into REST endpoints. Keep your development loop tight.

### [generate](generate.md) - Add complexity safely

Scaffold new components with the right patterns. Generate signatures, modules, and programs that integrate cleanly with your existing code and DSPy's optimizer.

## Aliases

- `s` → `serve`
- `g` → `generate`
